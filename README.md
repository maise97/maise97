- 👋 Hello, my name is Maise, but you can call me May. I'm 24 years old and I'm from Minas Gerais Brazil. 
- 💞️ I love Music, Games, and Programming, in addition, I love creating content for social networks, such as Youtube.
- 👀 Currently studying, I am studying Information Systems at UFVJM.
Despite being a beginner, I have a great performance in the area of ​​computing. 
I work autonomously with maintenance of computers and cell phones, cleaning, installing systems and applications.
In search of something bigger, I decided to focus on programming, which is something I love and want to learn. 
As a beginner in college, I learned the basics so far, but I'm currently looking for more knowledge, in order to get better development in the area.
